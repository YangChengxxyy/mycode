//! Pure desktop view-model: state, actions, and reducer.
//!
//! This module tree has no GPUI dependency. The render layer turns
//! [`WorkspaceState`] into elements and feeds [`DesktopAction`]s back, so the
//! product behavior stays testable without a GPU or window. This file is the
//! import facade; the declarations live in topical submodules and the
//! transitions in [`reduce`].
