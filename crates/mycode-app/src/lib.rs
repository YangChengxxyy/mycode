//! `mycode-app` — the application core, with no frontend dependency.
//!
//! Everything a MYCode frontend needs to drive is here: sessions, model
//! turns, tools and their hosts, MCP servers, web search, provider
//! credentials, self-update, and the durable settings. A frontend owns none
//! of it. It starts a [`CoreBridge`], sends [`BridgeCommand`]s, awaits
//! [`BridgeReply`]s, and renders the [`BridgeEvent`] stream; the values in
//! those messages are defined in [`protocol`].
//!
//! [`CoreBridge`] owns a dedicated thread with a current-thread tokio runtime
//! hosting the session service, so a frontend never touches tokio types and
//! its own executor stays free. Replies ride tokio oneshot channels, whose
//! receivers are executor-agnostic futures. Model turns run as concurrent
//! runtime tasks streaming events back through a channel the frontend awaits;
//! configuration reads stay synchronous on the same thread.
//!
//! The command channel is unbounded on purpose: the worker loop must `await`
//! commands instead of blocking the runtime thread, or spawned tasks (chat
//! turns, catalog refreshes) would starve until the next command arrives.
//! `UnboundedSender::send` is synchronous, so the caller never touches async
//! machinery.
//!
//! Module map: `dispatch` runs the command loop, `state` holds the shared
//! core state, `ledger` reads and writes session ledgers, `turn` drives one
//! model turn, `tool_hosts` bridges the host-backed tools, `oauth` runs the
//! provider device flows, `settings_io` persists settings and secrets,
//! `projection` renders display entries, `search` backs the composer's
//! `@` mention, `mcp_tools` bridges MCP servers, `subagent` hosts the `agent`
//! tool, and `compaction`, `export`, `updates`, `web_client`, and
//! `mcp_client` round out the housekeeping and I/O seams.
